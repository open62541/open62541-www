&lt;p&gt;This year did we again present open62541 at the Hannover Fair.
See below the &amp;ldquo;partner pod&amp;rdquo; at the booth of the OPC Foundation.
It was great connecting with the community directly after two years of remote work.
Thanks also to OSADL and Kalycito for co-organizing the booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new open62541-website is now finally online!
We also started to publish articles and news on the new website.
Make sure you read the great interview with Götz Görisch from the VDW – Verein Deutscher Werkzeugmaschinenfabriken e.V.

The website is built with the HUGO Framework (&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/"&gt;https://gohugo.io/&lt;/a&gt;) and the content is therefore completely written in markdown. The website is public visible in our open62541-www repository. The deploy process of the new webpage is automated by a github action. During the deploy phase the markdown files are compiled with the hugo tools to a static website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New responsive design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure static website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publicly visible in the open62541-www repository&lt;/li&gt;
