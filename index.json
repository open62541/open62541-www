Going forward, only fixes and non-breaking changes will be integrated in the 1.3 release family.\nNew features compared to the previous release series 1.2 include:\n Support for OPC UA PubSub encryption (also TPM-based key handling) Session authentication with x509 certificates (server-side) Support for Event Filters Support for Server Diagnostics Binary/JSON encoding as a stable public API Handling of Subscriptions with different priority Greatly improved Nodeset Compiler, including support for structure values Added UA_order function for all data types (equality test / absolute ordering for binary search trees, etc.) Support for TLS-encrypted MQTT-based PubSub Internally generate temporary self-signed certificates  Besides the major functional additions, many small features, fixes and general improvements went into this release. Particularly, the memory consumption of the information model was reduced by about 1/3 compared to the 1.2 release series.\nNote that the v1.3 release family contains new features compared to v1.0.

It reduces visual noise and makes the introspection of local variables much more convenient.\nPretty-printing can be activated by loading the definitions as source \u0026lt;open62541\u0026gt;/tools/gdb-pretty-print.py. Below are some before/after examples to showcase the effect.\nNodeIds have four different representations (numeric, string, guid, bytestring). This leads to a very cluttered gdb output due to the C-union where a numeric id is also interpreted as a (string) pointer.\nWith pretty-printing enabled, the NodeId is converted as a human-readable string. This is the standard-defined format that can also be parsed via UA_NodeId_parse.\nAnother complicated datatype is UA_Variant. A variant is a container that can wrap any other OPC UA data type, also as a (multi-dimensional) array. Printing a variant in GDB leads to a messy output. Particularly the data type information is not automatically resolved. Furthermore, the value is hidden behind an opaque void-pointer.\nThe variant is immediately understandable with pretty-printing enabled. In this example, the variant contains a scalar timestamp value.\n@Author Dr. -Ing.

The server implementation used for the certification can be found at https://github.com/open62541/open62541/blob/1.0/examples/server_ctt.c. No Certification Grandfathering: There is no grandfathering of certification, users who want their application based on open62541 to be certified need to undergo separate testing at the OPC Foundation Test Lab Certification is attempted for selected feature-sets (facets). Some features are implemented but not under test at this time. These features are disabled by default in the SDK:\nFeatures submitted for testing are based on granularity of \u0026ldquo;facets\u0026rdquo; (Micro Embedded Device Server, Method Facet, Node Management Facet and the SecurityPolicies). Some additional conformance units (e.g. for events) are already implemented. But the corresponding \u0026ldquo;facet\u0026rdquo; is not yet complete JSON encoding is implemented in open62541. But the feature cannot be certified due to the lack of official test cases and tools Historical data access is implemented in open62541. But the feature is not testable with the current CTT. We did however implement the standard test cases for historical data (that are part of the spec) in our unit tests At the time of writing this section (Sep 2019), PubSub (UADP) is implemented in open62541. But the feature cannot be certified due to the lack of official test cases and testing tools. We did however implement the standard cases used for the PubSub interoperability workshop, where we participated earlier this year. It should be noted that Kalycito is member of IIC TSN Testbed and OPC Foundation and Fraunhofer IOSB is a member of OPC Foundation. This enables us to closely follow the technology evolution path and be an early adopter. Interested in our work? Next steps to take OSADL continues to actively support the project and fosters addition of new features and functions. To do so it welcomes new participants who may select from various contribution levels as outlined at https://www.osadl.org/LoI2 As this is a rapidly evolving technology space, the official standards and compliance tools are evolving fast and the open source code is evolving fast as well. You might want to get external support to get your products certified and also integrate the latest feature additions to open source into your products as soon as possible. Kalycito provides such support for integration and certification and you can find more details abut their services at https://www.kalycito.com/opc-ua-sdk/.\n","permalink":"https://www.open62541.org/certification/","tags":null,"title":"Certified SDK"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Building from source\nA detailed description on how to build from source can be found here: Installing\nPrebuilt packages\nPrebuild binaries You can always find prebuild binaries for every release on our Github Release Page.\nOS Specific packages\nDebian packages can be found in our official PPA:\n Daily Builds (based on master branch): https://launchpad.net/~open62541-team/+archive/ubuntu/daily Release Builds (starting with Version 1.0): https://launchpad.net/~open62541-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa  To install the open62541-dev stable package in Ubuntu, use these lines:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:open62541-team/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libopen62541-1-dev ","permalink":"https://www.open62541.org/download/","tags":null,"title":"Team"}]
