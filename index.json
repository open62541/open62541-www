It contains only bugfixes compared to the v1.1 release. Newly included bugfixes are for:\n Export UA_Server_getStatistics Correctly handle RenewSecureChannel if there was no communication between renews Allow anonymous SecurityPolicies with an SecurityPolicyUri (for compatibility with existing SDK)  Major new feature introduced in the v1.1 release family are\n Support for DataTypes with Optional Fields and Unions Encrypted SecureChannel via the OpenSSL library (in addition to support via mbed TLS) Track the client state for SecureChannel and Session independently Comprehensive server statistics First support for RT-Linux ETL and XDP (Express Data Path) for realtime PubSub First support for Alarms and Conditions Note that the v1.1 release family contains new features compared to v1.0.

Later releases in the 1.0 release family contain only bugfixes in comparison to the certified version.\nCertification Limitations \u0026amp; Common Misconceptions:\nCertification was done for a reference server (\u0026ldquo;CTT server\u0026rdquo;) based on the open62541 SDK and not for the SDK itself. The server implementation used for the certification can be found at https://github.com/open62541/open62541/blob/1.0/examples/server_ctt.c. No Certification Grandfathering: There is no grandfathering of certification, users who want their application based on open62541 to be certified need to undergo separate testing at the OPC Foundation Test Lab Certification is attempted for selected feature-sets (facets). Some features are implemented but not under test at this time. These features are disabled by default in the SDK:\nFeatures submitted for testing are based on granularity of \u0026ldquo;facets\u0026rdquo; (Micro Embedded Device Server, Method Facet, Node Management Facet and the SecurityPolicies). Some additional conformance units (e.g. for events) are already implemented. But the corresponding \u0026ldquo;facet\u0026rdquo; is not yet complete JSON encoding is implemented in open62541. But the feature cannot be certified due to the lack of official test cases and tools Historical data access is implemented in open62541. But the feature is not testable with the current CTT. We did however implement the standard test cases for historical data (that are part of the spec) in our unit tests At the time of writing this section (Sep 2019), PubSub (UADP) is implemented in open62541. But the feature cannot be certified due to the lack of official test cases and testing tools. We did however implement the standard cases used for the PubSub interoperability workshop, where we participated earlier this year. It should be noted that Kalycito is member of IIC TSN Testbed and OPC Foundation and Fraunhofer IOSB is a member of OPC Foundation. This enables us to closely follow the technology evolution path and be an early adopter. Interested in our work? Next steps to take OSADL continues to actively support the project and fosters addition of new features and functions. To do so it welcomes new participants who may select from various contribution levels as outlined at https://www.osadl.org/LoI2 As this is a rapidly evolving technology space, the official standards and compliance tools are evolving fast and the open source code is evolving fast as well. You might want to get external support to get your products certified and also integrate the latest feature additions to open source into your products as soon as possible. Kalycito provides such support for integration and certification and you can find more details abut their services at https://www.kalycito.com/opc-ua-sdk/.\n","permalink":"https://open62541.github.io/open62541-www-staging/certified/","tags":null,"title":"Certified SDK"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://open62541.github.io/open62541-www-staging/articles/","tags":null,"title":"Blog"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The open62541-projekt has a new website!\nTogether with the open62541 1.2 release we are proud to present our new website.\nThe website is based on the Hugo Framework and all content is written in markdown.\n","permalink":"https://open62541.github.io/open62541-www-staging/articles/articles/20_10_10_opcua-tsn/","tags":null,"title":"New open62541 website released"},{"categories":null,"contents":"At Hannover Fair 2019, we demonstrated the open62541 Realtime OPC UA PubSub Publisher at the booth of the OPC Foundation.
