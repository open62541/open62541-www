The sample server (server_ctt) built using open62541 v1.0 is in conformance with the 'Micro Embedded Device Server' Profile of OPC Foundation supporting OPC UA client/server communication, subscriptions, method calls and security (encryption) with the security policies 'Basic128Rsa15', 'Basic256' and 'Basic256Sha256' and the facets 'method server' and 'node management'.

PubSub (UADP) is implemented in open62541. But the feature cannot be certified at this point in time (Sep-2019) due to the lack of official test cases and testing tools.

open62541 is maintained by a community of developers and users. The certified release v1.0 was prepared by Fraunhofer IOSB and Kalycito Infotech with funding from an industry consortium via the Open Source Automation Development Lab (OSADL) eG.

open62541 is developed and maintained by a community of contributors from a wide range of backgrounds. The certification is the result of the joint work of all contributors to open62541. The following organizations are mentioned explicitly for leading the certification effort on behalf of the overall community.
