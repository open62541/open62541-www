**✨ Developer training for OPC UA and open62541: Your key to industrial communication! ✨**

Take part in our three day OPC UA training and learn from the main developers of the open62541 OPC UA library.

In this workshop you will be introduced to the basics and advanced concepts of OPC UA. You will get a practical look at the architecture and structure of the OPC UA specification, the security mechanisms as well as the modeling and implementation of information models. Participants will develop applications using the open source open62541 library and learn the correct usage of the library as well as background information about the implementation from the main developers.

1. **Day 1**: Basics of OPC UA, information modeling and security concepts.
2. **Day 2**: Practical application of open62541 for client- and server development.
3. **Day 3**: Advanced mechanisms using pubsub and event handling.

Take the opportunity to speak with others and profit from the experience of our experts.
